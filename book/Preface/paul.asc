== Preface by Paul McQuade

(((Preface)))
I began writing this book as a way to escape from the nightmare of Covid-19.
As i write i wondered what can i do to make developing software easier on people. I realise that sharing my information about coding was to way to go.

I never wrote a book before and i had very little practical knowledge about KDE Plasma and KDE Frameworks. Writing a book would force me to think.
