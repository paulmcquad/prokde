=== Bug triaging


==== Summary

(((Bug triaging)))
The KDE Bugsquad keeps track of incoming bugs in KDE software, and goes through old bugs. They verify that a bug exists, whether it is reproducible, and that the reporter has given enough information. Their goal is to save developers from doing this, *which helps them fix bugs more quickly and do more work on KDE software.*

Getting involved in the Bugsquad is a good place to start. An existing member will help you out and mentor you. One of the great things about the Bugsquad and bug triaging is that *you do not need any programming knowledge!* 

That said, experience has shown that members of this team learn a lot about KDE and Qt programming during the course of dealing with bug reports, and many move on to developing the software itself. If you are just starting to learn programming, bug triaging is a great way to gain familiarity with the components and give practical support to the KDE community.
