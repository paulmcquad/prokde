==== Build Logs

(((Logs)))
When building KDE for the first time it can be a little hard to see the problem.

If you use the tool https://kdesrc-build.kde.org[kdesrc-build] it will build to a log file directory.

Following the guide here - https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development

The Log directory will be at ~/kde/src/log/  and it will be timestamped.
