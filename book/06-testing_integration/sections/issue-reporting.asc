(((Issue Reporting)))
If you've found a problem with a piece of KDE software or have an idea for an improvement, report it to the developers! QA is critically important to ensure quality, and you can be involved in an effort to make sure that our users are happy with the final products. https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/Issue_Reporting[Find out more about issue reporting].

==== Issue reporting involves responsibility

(((Bugzilla)))
Before you report a Bugzilla ticket, please make sure that you are:

* using relatively recent versions of KDE software (â‰¤ 1 year old) or an LTS supported version

* willing to do whatever is necessary to get the bug to happen again (if reporting a bug)

* willing to correspond with KDE developers about the issue, potentially over an extended period of time

* prepared to gather and report a lot of additional information

* ready to potentially use a terminal program to execute command line debugging tools

If those points all apply to you, then we can move on! Let's see now make sure that the issue you're experiencing is something that can be reported.

==== Step 0: Is it a security issue?

(((Security Issue)))
Do not file bug reports for security issues, as this makes the vulnerability public and could expose users to exploits. Instead, send an email to security@kde.org. For more information, see https://kde.org/info/security/.

==== Step 1: Make sure it's a valid bug or feature request

(((Bug)))
(((Feature Request)))
Real issues involve any of the following:

* Crashes

* Broken functionality

* Anything that causes data loss

* Design issues, such as faulty paddings/margins, misplaced content, lack of consistency with the rest of the desktop, incorrect icon/image rendering, or other user interface anomalies

* Translation problems, where certain words or expressions are inappropriate for a given context, or a part of a program that was not properly translated or is lacking translation

* Typographic errors (typos), unclear instructions or general communication, inappropriate grammar or style, or not conveying a program's functionality correctly
    
* Usability issues, such as inappropriate default window sizes, excessive or non-optimal amount of clicks to achieve a task, and others

* Accessibility issues, such as text or software itself that cannot be used with a text-to-speech interface or screen reader

* Request for missing features or ideas about how something that's already working could be further improved

If your issue is on this list, *proceed onto step 2*.

By contrast, here are some examples of issues that are almost never real issues:

* Vague and subjective matters of aesthetics or personal preference (e.g. "The program is ugly")

* Design choices too broad to be changed by a Bugzilla ticket (e.g. "The program should work more like this other program that I'm used to")

* Anything caused by user or vendor configuration choices (e.g. "The program disappeared after I did a system update")

* Support questions ("How do I change such-and-such behavior of the program?")

* Development assistance requests ("Can you help me compile the program?")

Do not file *Bugzilla tickets for these kinds of issues*. Instead, you might try bringing up the matter on the https://forum.kde.org/[KDE forum] or another online discussion group of your choice.

Here are examples of issues that _may_ be valid, but require some more investigation:

* "The program is really slow" (It could be a bug in the software, or it could be an issue with your computer or its configuration)

* "Some of the program's icons are inconsistent" (If you're using a 3rd-party icon theme, that could be causing the problem)

* "The program did something unexpected in response to an action that I took" (this could be a bug or a usability issue, or it could just be that the program's operation is unfamiliar to you)

* "The label for one of the program's user interface controls doesn't clearly indicate what it does" (It could be a badly-worded or badly-translated piece of text, or it could be a 3rd-party widget theme mangling the user interface)

If your issue is on this list, *proceed to Step 2*, but be prepared for the issue to be caused by configuration or hardware issues, or simply be an example of unfamiliar behavior.

==== Step 2: Make sure it hasn't already been fixed
