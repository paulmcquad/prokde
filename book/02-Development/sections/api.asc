=== API

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of functions exposed by a program or library that can be invoked by other programmers. An API greatly extends a program by allowing third-party developers to add new functionality. It is an ideal way to allow new features to be added without the need to modify the existing, core code.

For most of these requirements, it is best to use the packages provided by your operating system distribution, but in some cases you will need to build these requirements yourself.
