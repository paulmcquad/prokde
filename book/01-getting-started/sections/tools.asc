It provides lots of tools for figuring out where you have gone as you edit files, as well as merging your changes with those made by other developers.You can find more about git (and download it if necessary) at:

===== An IDE

An integrated development environment (IDE) allows you to do project management, testing, and other activities in a convenient way alongside your coding. We recommend that you install one of the following IDEs and do your KDE development work within it. 

We recommend QtCreator for its ease of use and features, especially its built-in text editor. But it's nice to know, if you're familiar with KDevelop already, that you can use that for KDE development too.

*QT Creator*

Qt Creator is a cross-platform C++, JavaScript and QML integrated development environment which simplifies GUI application development. It is part of the SDK for the Qt GUI application development framework and uses the Qt API, which encapsulates host OS GUI function calls.

*KDevelop*

KDevelop is a free and open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for Unix-like computer operating systems and Windows. It provides editing, navigation and debugging features for several programming languages, and integration with build automation and version-control systems, using a plugin-based architecture.

*Visual Studio Code*

Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.

===== CMake

CMake is KDE's build system of choice. Once you have this, you can use it to configure a software project for building, and that process will tell you of any other requirements you are missing. *NOTE: KDE Frameworks can also be used in QMake-based projects.*
