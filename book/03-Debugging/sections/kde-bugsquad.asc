=== KDE Bugsquad

The KDE Bugsquad keeps track of incoming bugs in KDE software, and goes through old bugs. They verify that a bug exists, whether it is reproducible, and that the reporter has given enough information. Their goal is to save developers from doing this, which helps them fix bugs more quickly and do more work on KDE software.

To join the https://phabricator.kde.org/project/update/290/join/[Bugsquad], become a member of our project on https://phabricator.kde.org/project/profile/290/[Phabricator]. We organize Bug Days, where we focus on a specific product, with the goal of reviewing all open bugs by the end of the day. These meetings occur primarily on #kde-bugs.
