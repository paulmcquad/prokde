=== Setup An KDE Account

==== About KDE Identity Account

In order to submit merge requests with GitLab, you'll need a KDE Identity Account.

These can be registered using the self-service Identity site. As part of this process, you will need to provide a name and email address, which has to be your own. Please note that these details will be made publicly visible on Gitlab once you have logged in there. You may therefore receive some spam as an unfortunate consequence of this.

When selecting your username, please ensure you select something which has a relation to your real name.

*A Developer Account is not needed to fork repositories and submit merge requests on Gitlab.*

Also note that this email address should be the same one that you use on bugs.kde.org. If you don't have an account in bugs.kde.org, please create one so that it can be given usual developer rights. Closing bug reports with keywords in commit comments only works if the email address associated with your KDE Developer account and https://bugs.kde.org[bugs.kde.org] accounts match.

I removed the LINK details but you get the idea.
